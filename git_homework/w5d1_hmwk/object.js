********* Create a Story with your Person class ***********

Feel free to update or add methods to automate some of these tasks.

Instantiate a new Person named Timmy
Age Timmy five years
At this point Timmy's a little bummed. As a precocious child, he feels he's "seen it all" already. Have him eat five times.
Now Timmy's a little heavier than he wants to be. Kindergarten's coming up and he wants to look good. Have him exercise five times
Age Timmy 9 years
Create a hamster named "Gus"
Set Gus's owner to the string "Timmy"
Have Timmy "buy" Gus
Age Timmy 15 years
Have Timmy eat twice
Have Timmy exercise twice
