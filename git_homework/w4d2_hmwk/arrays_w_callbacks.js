~~~~~~~~  Section 3 Array Methods with Callbacks  ~~~~~~~~~~

A few array methods use callbacks. For example .map - .map takes each element of an array and does something to it and 
returns a new arrays.

But what should it do? Multiply everything by 5? Capitalize everything? If .map had a hard-coded thing it always 
did with an array, it wouldn't be very flexible.

By allowing a callback to determine what happens to each array element we get a lot of flexibility and we can do some 
really powerful things.

Two arrays to work with:

*/


const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0]

const panagram = ['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']



// The first question is for the numbers array. The second question is for the words array.


// You don't have to write an answer to the thought questions.

// ------ ----- ----- Every: ------ ----- ----- 
// Determine if every number is greater than or equal to 0
// determine if every word shorter than 8 characters


// ------ ----- -----  Filter:  ------ ----- ----- 
// filter the array for numbers less than 4
// filter words that have an even length


// ------ ----- -----  Find: ------ ----- ----- 
// Find the first value divisible by 5
// find the first word that is longer than 5 characters


// ------ ----- -----  Find Index:  ------ ----- ----- 
// find the index of the first number that is divisible by 3
// find the index of the first word that is less than 2 characters long


// ------ ----- -----   For Each:  ------ ----- ----- 
// console.log each value of the nums array multiplied by 3
// console.log each word with an exclamation point at the end of it



// Thought Questions:

// What happened to the original array?
// Can you store the values from a forEach method in a new array?


// ------ ----- -----  Map:  ------ ----- ----- 
// make a new array of each number multiplied by 100
// make a new array of all the words in all uppercase



// Thought Questions:
// What happened to the original array?
// Can you store the values from a map method in a new array?


// ------ ----- -----   Some:  ------ ----- ----- 
// Find out if some numbers are divisible by 7
// Find out if some words have the letter a in them
